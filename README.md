# Movie-Recomendation-System

A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on title similarity using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

## How It Works

The system uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert movie titles into numerical representations. It then calculates cosine similarity between movies to find the most similar titles based on textual similarity.

## Example Output
When searching for "Avengers: Infinity War", the system might return:

-Avengers: Endgame
-The Avengers
-Avengers: Age of Ultron
-Avengers Assemble
-Ultimate Avengers
